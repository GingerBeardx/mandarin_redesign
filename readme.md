# Mandarin Garden Menu Redesign

Mandaring Garden in Logan, UT is one of my favorite restaurants. In particular, I love their tiny, spicy chicken which can best be described as a spicy variation of the more common sweet and shour chicken.

Their current web site is incredibly basic and looks like something that might have looked alright in the early 2000's, but is certainly in need of a refresh.

I've decdied to take on the task of redesigning their site to have a more modern feel and to enhance its readability and responsiveness.
